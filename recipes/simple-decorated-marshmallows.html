		<h1>Simple Decorated Marshmallows</h1>
		<p>This is a very simple marshmallow recipe that I originally created for Halloween. The recipe is super easy to follow and the marshmallows can be decorated any way you want for whatever yu need them for.</p>

          <p>Lightly butter or spray a nine by thirteen inch baking pan. Dust the bottom and sides of the pan with powdered sugar. In a small bowl, mix the gelatin packets and half of the cold water and let it sit for at least five minutes.</p>
          <p>Dissolve the sugar in the remaining water and corn syrup in a large saucepan over medium heat to create a sugar syrup. Let the sugar syrup boil until a candy thermometer reaches 240Â°F. Brush the sides of the saucepan down with water so that sugar crystals form.</p>
          <p>Microwave or heat the gelatin mixture and mix on low speed in an electric mixture. Slowly pour the sugar syrup into the electric mixer and gradually increase the speed to high. Add the vanilla extract. Keep beating on high speeds until the mixture has become white, opaque, and has tripled in volume.</p>
          <p>Pour the mixture into the prepared pan and smooth the top of the marshmallows with the back of a spoon or a spatula. Dust the top of the marshmallows with more powdered sugar. Let the marshmallows sit uncovered for at least six hours.</p>
          <p>Cut the marshmallow into squares about two to three inches wide. Using a stencil cut out from a piece of paper on top of the marshmallows, dust the marshmallows with cocoa powder. Do not dust too heavily or too light or the design will not come out well. I recommend practicing on a plate or cutting board so you know how much cocoa powder to use.</p>
